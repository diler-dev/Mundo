## Mundo

Mundo is a mapping system written for the MongoDB Database and the [Kohana Framework](http://kohanaframework.org/).

It's currently in alpha - just released - and can do the following:

* Validate model data (including embedded objects and collections)
* Provide an object for the model's state and data
* Automatically update collections using atomic operations where possible

There's example usage in the tests folder and the code is well commented (hopefully).

It's been unit tested and has complete line coverage, but it's not quite comprehensive yet. Any help welcome ;)

Stay tuned for more info!
